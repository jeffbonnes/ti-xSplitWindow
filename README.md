# TixSplitView
A cross platform SplitView that adds some sugar to the Ti.iPad split view to make it more iOS email like. Also works on Android Tablets.

You need to be using [TiXUI](https://github.com/jeffbonnes/TiXUI) to get navBars on Android.

## Notes
Still a work in progress - need to work on a xNavigationWindow and get some better graphics.
